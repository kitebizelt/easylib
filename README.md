## What's easylib?
Easylib was made to ease the using of [libGdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx), created by Ahmad Fatih (kitebizelt) on 2016 August.
easylib has many features such as:
- **easy objects**:<br/>

- __easy scene__:<br/>
  draws objects to SpriteBatch automatically, access gravity strengh and much more!
- __easy render:__ (not yet finished) <br/>
  switch scene, add loading screen, access most of the Gdx functions

## Why easylib?
